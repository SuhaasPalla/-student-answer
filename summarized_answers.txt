Your output must mirror this format, replacing the Answer with your Summary:
    "section" "question" "Summary"

Separate each output entry with one blank line.
Example:

    "I" "1" "Our environment contains quantifiable resources that satisfy human needs."

    "I" "2" "Examples include Tarkand, Schicktishigar, and regions of Madhya Pradesh."

    "II" "6" "Oceanic resources beyond 200 nautical miles are managed by international institutions."

you MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.
