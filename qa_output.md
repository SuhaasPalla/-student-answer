# Social Studies Question Answer Key

## Section I (1×5=5M)

## Question 1: What do you understand by Resource?
Resources are naturally occurring or human-made materials that have utility and value for humans. They include natural resources (like minerals, water, forests), human resources (knowledge, skills), and human-made resources (buildings, technology). Resources are characterized by utility, availability, and potential for development. Their value can change based on technological development, cultural preferences, and economic factors.

## Question 2: Which states in India are rich in minerals and coal deposits?
Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh are particularly rich in minerals and coal deposits Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh together form part of the Chota Nagpur plateau which contains some of India's largest mineral reserves. Other mineral-rich states include Maharashtra (manganese), Karnataka (iron ore), and Rajasthan (zinc, copper).

## Question 3: Which report in 1987 introduced the concept of 'Sustainable Development'?
The "Our Common Future" report, also known as the Brundtland Report, published by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in 1987, introduced the concept of 'Sustainable Development'. The report defined sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."

## Question 4: What is the total geographical area of India?
The total geographical area of India is approximately 3.287 million square kilometers (or about 328.7 million hectares). This makes India the seventh-largest country in the world by land area

## Question 5: How much degraded land is in India?
Approximately 96.4 million hectares (about 29.32% of India's total geographical area) is degraded land in India. This includes land affected by water and wind erosion, salinity, soil acidity, waterlogging, and other forms of land degradation.

## Section II (2×1=2M)

## Question 5: What do you understand by International resources? Give example.
International resources are resources that are regulated by international institutions and are not owned by a single country. They exist beyond national boundaries and are governed by international agreements and conventions. Examples include:
. The ocean resources beyond territorial waters (international waters)
. Antarctica, which is regulated by the Antarctic Treaty System
· Outer space and celestial bodies as defined by the Outer Space Treaty
. The atmosphere as a shared global resource
. Certain international river systems shared by multiple countries

## Section III (4×2=8M)

## Question 7: Mention some features of arid soil.
A)|Features of arid soil include:
Light texture with sandy or sandy-loam consistency
. Low organic matter content due to sparse vegetation
. High mineral content, particularly salts
Low moisture retention capacity
High pH value (alkaline in nature)
Low in nitrogen and often phosphorus
Presence of calcium carbonate and gypsum
Susceptible to wind erosion
Light color (typically reddish-brown to pale brown)
Poorly developed soil profile with thin horizons

## Question 8: Explain the role of humans in resource development.
A) Humans play a crucial role in resource development through:
1. Identification and discovery of resources through research and exploration
2. Development of technology to access, extract, and process resources more efficiently
3. Creation of infrastructure for resource utilization and distribution
4. Transformation of natural materials into more valuable forms through manufacturing
5. Conservation and sustainable management practices to prevent resource depletion
6. Creation of human-made resources through knowledge, skills and innovation
7. Resource planning and policy implementation for optimal resource allocation
